Noise was a large issue here. In order to deal with the noise, a complementary
filter was used to smoothen the Euler angle input. The filter itself does
introduce lag to the system, so any further smoothing of the still noisy
derivative resulted in unexpected results. Instead, the gyro input data was
taken and then smoothed using a linear box filter. This produced generally
usable values for most throttle values, but the highest options could 
potentially be changed (a 4.2V battery was used instead of a 3.7V battery).
