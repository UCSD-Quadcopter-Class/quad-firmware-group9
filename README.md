# CSE 190 - QUAD-FIRMWARE

This repo contains all of the Arduino sketches and modified libraries required to run the firmware for the quadcopter and controller. All code is still generally a work in progress...

## What do the Directories Contain?

### `./MultiWii*`
Any directories that start with MultiWii are currently not in use. MultiWii is a flight control software that will be used later.

### `./firmware`
Contains the firmware for both the remote and the quadcopter. This directory also contains any necessary modified libraries.

### `./lab_writeups`
Contains any written reports that need to be submitted, should any be needed.
